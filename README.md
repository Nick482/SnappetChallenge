Snappet challenge

Tried to make it more convenient, so the only thing needed to launch the server is to install the dependencies and run the `npm start` script.

Starts on `localhost:4200`, you will see a side navigation with two buttons, Daily and Monthly:

- Daily is the default task of the challenge, slightly expanded to allow for viewing of other days.
- Monthly shows general statistics for the entire month, and allows to view some monthly data for separate students.

A lot can be expanded upon, to improve UX, like relative progress, more detailed data on subjects, and goals.

Focused on FE part, so DashboardService basically emulates a DB with some basic transformation, and data processing.
